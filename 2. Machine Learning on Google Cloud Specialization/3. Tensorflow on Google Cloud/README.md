# Tensorflow on Google Cloud

## Week1

- **Introduction to the Tensorflow Ecosystem**
  - Recall the TensorFlow API hierarchy
  - Understand TensorFlowâ€™s building blocks: Tensors and operations
  - Write low-level TensorFlow programs

- **Design and Build Input Data Pipelines**
  - Train on large datasets with tf.data
  - Work with in-memory files
  - Get the data ready for training
  - Describe embeddings
  - Understand scaling data with tf.Keras preprocessing layers
  - In the labs, you will learn how to:
    - Use tf.data to read data from memory.
    - Use tf.data in a training loop.
    - Use tf.data to read data from disk.
    - Write production input pipelines with feature engineering (batching, shuffling, etc.).
    - Map from columns in the CSV to features used to train the model using Keras preprocessing layers.
    - Build, train, and evaluate a model using Keras.
