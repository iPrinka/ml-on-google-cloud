BigQuery ML:

- BigQuery ML enables users to create and execute machine learning models in BigQuery using SQL queries. The goal is to democratize machine learning by enabling SQL practitioners to build models using their existing tools and to increase development speed by eliminating the need for data movement.

Empirical Risk Minimization:

- A machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss. This process is called empirical risk minimization.
- Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction: a number indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater. The goal of training a model is to find a set of weights and biases that have low loss, on average, across all examples.

R^2 Score:

- The R2 score is a statistical measure that determines whether the linear regression predictions approximate the actual data. 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around the mean. 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around the mean.
