Improving Data Quality

- Machine learning models can only consume numeric data, and that numeric data should be 1s or 0s. 
- Data is said to be messy or untidy if it is missing attribute values, contains noise or outliers, has duplicates, wrong data, or upper/lower case column names, or is essentially not ready for ingestion by a machine learning algorithm.
